# Day 5: A Maze of Twisty Trampolines, All Alike

## Part 1 and Part 2

The solution is to read the problem and code exactly what it says to do. Not much else to discuss.

This is a problem that _feels_ like it should have some type of mathematical solution...but I ultimately don't think there is (but happy to be proven wrong). That pesky increment/decrement by `1` feels to me like it makes the problem [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) (in the mathematical sense).
