# Advent of Code 2016

This is my [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016) repository. I will push all of my code to here, and I might even include `README.md` files with explanations if I feel inclined.

## How to Run

All code is designed to be run at root of each year. In this case, inside the top level of `2016/`. Each day has `part_1.py` and `part_2.py`. For example,

```
cd 2016/
python -m Day_01.part_1
```

and more generally

```
python -m Day_XX.part_Y
```

where `XX` is the the two digit day number (e.g. use `01` instead of `1`) and `Y` is the part number.

## Structure of Code

Each `Day_XX` has its own folder. Additionally, in there is `utils/` which contains some helper code used thoughout.

### Day_XX

Each `Day_XX` folder generally has the following files, although there is some variation
- `const.py` - configuration constants
- `example_input.txt` - example input
- `input.txt` - challenge input
- `load_input.py` - converts the `.txt` input files into appropriate python objects
- `part_1.py` - solution to part 1
- `part_2.py` - solution to part 2
- `README.md` - explanation of solutions
