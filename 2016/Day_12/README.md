# Day 12: Leonardo's Monorail

## Part 1

This is another problem where the solution is to just similate as described by the problem. The instruction logic is written in `opcodes.py`. In `part_1.py`, the `compile()` function compiles the opcodes, maintaining the registers and a program counter (`pc`).

## Part 2 

Exactly the same as part 1, just a different initial configuration of the registers.
