# Day 16: Dragon Checksum

[Problem Link](https://adventofcode.com/2016/day/16)

## Part 1

I think Python obfuscates some of the annoyances with this problem, like the fact I can convert between binary integers and strings at will, and the fact it can just handle crazy large strings. 

I just simulated the problem as described in the functions `dragon()` and `checksum()`.

## Part 2 

Same as part 1 but with a larger input.
